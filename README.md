Data pre-processing and analysis were performed on the specified TCR open source data set. The distance matrix was computed and the similarity of TCR sequences was compared using the tcrdist tool. Furthermore, dimensionality reduction techniques, notably T-SNE, were used to visualize the TCRs. The TCRs were then clustered using common machine learning methods including K-means and Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering (AHC), and the clustering effect was evaluated through a series of indicators. Finally, TCR specificity was predicted by approaching it as a classification task. An attempt was made to use the distance matrix computed by tcrdist3 as training data. Copy
