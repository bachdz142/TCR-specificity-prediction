This project focus on enhancing conversion rate prediction accuracy for marketing campaign in OMD, a leading media agency. The goal is obtained by optimizing and evaluating various machine learning model. Conversion rate prediction plays a crucial role in online advertising as it helps with bidding strategy and maximize advertiser return on investment. The dissertation implement and compare multiple models, from traditional linear methods, tree-based model such as XGBoost, advanced deep learning approaches such as DeepFM and FinalMLP. The challenge addressed in the the project is the data sparsity and underlying data imbalance in conversion rate prediction which leads to biased and overfitting models.
The project contribution include a thorough data preprocessing steps including feature engineering, encoding technique, the utilization of Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique for Regression with Gaussian Noise (SMOGN) to address data imbalance challenge. The most impactful feature that influ- ences the conversion rate are determined by the use of SHAP analysis and XGBoostâ€™s feature importance, supporting model interpretability and optimization.
